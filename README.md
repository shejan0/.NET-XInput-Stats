# .NET XInput Controller stats and Vibration tester
### by Shejan Shuza

Made for fun, plays Xbox Original audio and uses XInput API
to query the controller statuses and update the Vibration states.

The Xbox sounds were pulled from [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJO728mCdmQ) to .wav and placed inside of the XboxController folder, its not included due to it being larger than 100MB in WAV form (WAV is uncompressed)

BUILT FOR USE IN WINDOWS, Utilizes [SharpDX.XInput](https://github.com/sharpdx/SharpDX)

Built in Visual Studio Community 2019
